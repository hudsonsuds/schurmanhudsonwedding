			<h3>Weather</h3>
			<p>
				Carmel Valley is set in from the coast, so typically experiences less of the cloudy foggy weather than can be found near the shore at the same time of year. Average temperatures during the day in Carmel Valley in October are between low 70s and mid 90s, with almost no humidity and lots of sunshine. Mornings and evenings can be <u><em>much cooler</em></u>. We recommend bringing layers for the evenings in the Valley or along the coast. 
			</p>
			<p>
				All part of our wedding events (from the Rehearsal Dinner to the Ceremony and Reception) are outdoors. We presume the ceremony and cocktail hour will be very warm with direct sun, and the evening can be a bit cooler (we’d will have heat lamps and blankets!). There is indoor space to relax or warm up if needed. The entire property is all ours, so plenty of places to tuck away a jacket or shawl for later if you’d like, but we encourage drinking and dancing to keep you warm!
			</p>
			<p>
				Check the weather report before you depart. Although it is a dry time of year, you never know when Northern California can expect showers.
